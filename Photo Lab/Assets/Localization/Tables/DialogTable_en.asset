    m_Localized: Mauro{} Wow, I'm glad you haven't closed yet! I came running because

    m_Localized: Mauro{} Well, actually I work at the newspaper. My name is Mauro,
      I'm a journalist and photographer for Informes Populares. I really need your
      help, the newspaper's enlarger broke, and I need to enlarge this photo for
      tomorrow's cover story!

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 23
    m_Localized: Mauro{} I'm back, Ana. I hope you got a good enlargement. I brought
      Captain Guedes to take a look at the photo, as you may have seen, it is the
      scene of a crime.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 26
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Don't give me another one of those crazy things from your
      newspaper. This shining can be a reflection of anything, there is no reason
      to create a public fuss. Come on young lady, take this photo and erase the
      reflection, I know you can do it.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 38
    m_Localized: Ana{} You're new in town, aren't you? The registry office here will
      not accept a photo from outside, they take it themselves.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 39
    m_Localized: Vicente{} The photo is not for taking a document! It's to put on
      my badge, I'm the new engineer for the construction company that is carrying
      out the expansion works in the city.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 41
    m_Localized: "Vicente{} The Mayor's project is to build a structure for an industrial

    m_Localized: Guedes{} Good morning Miss Rizzo, I didn't have the opportunity
      to comment the other day, but you are doing a great job taking care of the
      store, your old father would be proud.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 49
    m_Localized: Ana{} Did you know my father?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 50
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Yes, your father was very well known in the city, many
      years ago our Mayor even invited him to run for councilman, but his father
      didn't want to.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 51
    m_Localized: Ana{} Wow, he never told me about that. I can't imagine my father
      getting involved in politics, even more so allying himself with this Mayor...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 52
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Well, some people don't know how to take advantage of the
      opportunities that life gives.
    m_Metadata:

      something?

  - m_Id: 54
    m_Localized: Guedes{} I brought a photo to develop. This is confidential material,

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Guedes{} Don't tell anyone about what you saw in this photo. This
      includes the Journalist and even any other guard employee.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Mauro{} But I think this photo will reveal the mystery behind the
      deaths that have been happening.

    m_Localized: Ana{} What do you mean?

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 66
    m_Localized: Mauro{} The police have enforced a curfew and no one can be on the
      street after 8pm, but today I managed to stay on the lookout and photograph
      the moment of an attack.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 67
    m_Localized: Ana{} So, did you see what it was?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 68
    m_Localized: Mauro{} It was very dark and everything happened very quickly, I
      just pointed the camera and took the photo. But there's a good chance something
      was in the photo, so I came running to bring it to you to reveal.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 69
    m_Localized: Ana{} Okay, wait here and I'll be right back.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 70
    m_Localized: Ana{} Here it is, you actually managed to photograph the creature.
      Is this really an animal?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 71
    m_Localized: Ana{} It's a shame it was very dark, I couldn't see many details...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 72
    m_Localized: Mauro{} That's it! Look how gigantic this creature's mouth is, it's
      not just any animal.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73
    m_Localized: Mauro{} I was already imagining that the photo would come out dark,
      it all happened so quickly that I couldn't adjust the camera.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74
    m_Localized: Mauro{} But can't you lighten the photo a little to see if anything
      else appears?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 75
    m_Localized: Ana{} I can try.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Ana{} Okay Mauro, I did the best I could.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 79
    m_Localized: Mauro{} Give me this photo back!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 80
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Forget it, I'm going to seize your camera and your videos,
      plus you're going to the police station with me for breaking curfew.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 81
    m_Localized: Mauro{} Let me go!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 82
    m_Localized: Guedes{} I think you'd better close the store Ana, according to
      the Mayor's decree, no business can stay open after 7pm, otherwise I'll have
      to take you too.
    m_Metadata:

      happen?

  - m_Id: 94
    m_Localized: "Tain\xE1{} My grandfather doesn't like taking photos, he says that
      portraits imprison the person's soul, it's an old family belief, no one before
      my mother took a portrait. It's a shame I don't have a record of them, but
      I respect my grandfather's beliefs, whether he likes it or not, they are a
      link to our ancestors."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 95
    m_Localized: Ana{} Well, photos are not the only way to keep memories and you

    m_Localized: Guedes{} Hello young lady, you were friends with that journalist,
      weren't you? I'm sorry, this wouldn't have happened if he had listened to the
      police and respected the curfew.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 98
    m_Localized: Ana{} None of this would have happened if the city had been safe...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 99
    m_Localized: Guedes{} What are you insinuating? The police have done everything
      in their power to keep the city safe.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 100
    m_Localized: Ana{} So why didn't they let Mauro publish the photo of the creature
      in the newspaper? The population needs to know the truth about what is happening.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 101
    m_Localized: Guedes{} This newspaper just wants to create sensationalism to sell
      more, and have you ever thought about whether this monster story is starting
      to spread? This year there is an election and our Mayor would have his reputation
      tarnished. He gave me the mission of resolving this issue without creating
      a fuss, and we will do it!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 102
    m_Localized: Ana{} Now everything makes sense, this Mayor is more concerned with
      carrying out works to get re-elected than with the lives of the population.
      But you should warn him that if everyone in town dies, there won't be anyone
      left to vote for him.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 103
    m_Localized: Guedes{} I hope your stomach is as strong as your opinion. Here,
      this is the photo of the last attack, I need it today to attach to the investigation
      file.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 104
    m_Localized: Ana{} Here is your photo, the attack was this morning? I saw it
      was on the front street, but I didn't hear anything.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 105
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Yes, it was, the attacks started to spread throughout the
      city, so if you don't want to have the same luck as your friend, don't try
      to act like a hero and don't leave the house at night.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Localized: Mauro{} Hello, Ana, thank you very much for your help. Thanks to
      you, everyone now knows that there really is a creature attacking the city.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 107
    m_Localized: Ana{} I only revealed one photo, you were the one who took the risk
      to take it and you were still arrested for it. What did they do to you?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 108
    m_Localized: Mauro{} Nothing, they just held me there for as long as they could
      to prevent me from publishing something in the newspaper, little did they know
      that the photo was already going to be written.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Ana{} Wait, so you weren't the one who left the note?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 110
    m_Localized: Mauro{} No, I asked to make a call to my lawyer, but in fact I called
      the editor-in-chief of the newspaper and said that you had a copy of the photo,
      she was the one who left the note and went to get it.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
