      m_Items: []

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 46
    m_Localized: Vicente{} The photo is not for taking a document! It's to put on
      my badge, I'm the new engineer for the construction company that is carrying

    m_Localized: Guedes{} Good morning Miss Rizzo, I didn't have the opportunity
      to comment the other day, but you are doing a great job taking care of the

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 57
    m_Localized: Ana{} Did you know my father?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 58
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Yes, your father was very well known in the city, even
      many years ago our Mayor invited him to run for councilman, but his father
      didn't want to.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 59
    m_Localized: Ana{} Wow, he never told me about that. I can't imagine my father
      getting involved in politics, even more so allying himself with this Mayor...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 60
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Well, some people don't know how to take advantage of the
      opportunities that life gives.
    m_Metadata:

      clients' photos.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Guedes{} Where is the photo?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Ana{} It's here
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 67
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Don't tell anyone about what you saw in this photo. This

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 68
    m_Localized: Ana{} It's fine.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: Ana{} Do you know what time it is? The store only opens tomorrow
      morning.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 71
    m_Localized: Mauro{} I know, I'm sorry to show up at this time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 72
    m_Localized: Mauro{} But I think this photo will reveal the mystery behind the
      deaths that have been happening.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 73
    m_Localized: Ana{} What do you mean?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 74
    m_Localized: Mauro{} The police have enforced a curfew and no one can be on the
      street after 8pm, but today I managed to stay on the lookout and photograph
      the moment of an attack.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 75
    m_Localized: Ana{} So, did you see what it was?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 76
    m_Localized: Mauro{} It was very dark and everything happened very quickly, I
      just pointed the camera and took the photo. But there's a good chance something
      was in the photo, so I came running to bring it to you to reveal.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 77
    m_Localized: Ana{} Okay, wait here and I'll be right back.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 78
    m_Localized: Ana{} Here it is, you actually managed to photograph the creature.
      Is this really an animal?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 79
    m_Localized: Ana{} It's a shame it was very dark, I couldn't see many details...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 80
    m_Localized: Mauro{} That's it! Look how gigantic this creature's mouth is, it's
      not just any animal.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 81
    m_Localized: Mauro{} I was already imagining that the photo would come out dark,
      it all happened so quickly that I couldn't adjust the camera.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 82
    m_Localized: Mauro{} But can't you lighten the photo a little to see if anything
      else appears?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 83
    m_Localized: Ana{} I can try.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 84
    m_Localized: Ana{} Okay Mauro, I did the best I could.
    m_Metadata:

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 86
    m_Localized: Guedes{} I knew I would find you here! But what is this? Give me
      that photo, don't you dare publish it in your newspaper!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 87
    m_Localized: Mauro{} Give me this photo back!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 88
    m_Localized: Guedes{} Forget it, I'm going to seize your camera and your videos,
      plus you're going to the police station with me for breaking curfew.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 89
    m_Localized: Mauro{} Let me go!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 90
    m_Localized: Guedes{} I think you'd better close the store Ana, according to
      the Mayor's decree, no businesses can stay open after 7pm, otherwise I'll have
      to take you too.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
